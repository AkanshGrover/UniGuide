# UniGuide

UniGuide is a simple application designed to help new students, visitors and staff easily navigate the complex layout of a university campus. It provides clear, efficient routes between campus buildings and landmarks, ensuring users can reach their destinations quickly and effortlessly. The app also supports GPS tracking, allowing users to obtain their current location with the press of a button, which is then used as the starting point for providing accurate navigation. Currently, the app is limited to the UPES campus. <br>Below are some recordings of the app in action:
